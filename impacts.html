     <h3 style="text-align:center; font-size:40px;">Damage of Typhoon Glenda</h3>
     <hr>
     <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 20px;">Typhoon Glenda stayed in Sorsogon for only four hours but it took the lives of two people and injured eight. The destruction it left in its wake amounted to seven billion pesos worth of damages to agriculture, fisheries, livestock, houses, and government infrastructures. This disaster really placed the affected areas under the State of Calamity. 
     </p> <br>
     <p style="text-align: justify;font-size: 20px;">
      Out of 525,791 people or 99,458 families were displaced and evacuated to 1,200 evacuation centers. A total of 26,259 houses were damaged by Glenda.

                The typhoon caused minor landslides in parts of Northern Luzon before leaving the Philippines’ territory and that greatly affected the roads that include the Bontoc road,Ilocos Sur road, and the mountain-province of Cagayan(Via tabuk) Enrile road. People say they are witnessing things in their coastal areas that they have never encountered before. They had encountered a storm surge and a significant rise in the sea. It's the first time, and it also has an impact on the nearby communities because flooding and house destruction are both caused by this tragedy.

   <h3 style="text-align:center; font-size:40px;">Community Preparedness and Recovery</h3>
   <hr>
   <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 20px;">Philippines' National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC), which issues warnings several times each day, helped to prepare the populace. Legazpi, in the province of Albay, is where the storm's center will pass as this preparedness system is put to the test. A few days before and after Typhoon Glenda made landfall, the entire province of Sorsogon erupted in action. More than 59,000 families were evacuated from Sorsogon City and its 14 municipalities before the typhoon's arrival thanks to pre-emptive evacuation plans coordinated at the barangay (village)level by the province. Airlines stopped operating in Legazpi and the neighboring areas last  July 15 for them to avoid the worst case scenarios.

    According to Salceda, the local administration would also take the following measures to help them begin their recovery.For one more day, all levels of classes will be canceled to allow for the clearing and cleaning of school grounds as well as to provide students time to help around the house.
Teams from the local APEC, DPWH (Department of Public Works and Highways), and PNP (Philippine National Police) should be sent out right away to clear any obstructions to traffic, including downed trees, electric posts, and broken cables.
   </p><br>
   <p style="text-align: justify;font-size: 20px;">PDNA teams will be organized in a full council meeting of the PDRRMC in order to assess damage and propose/compose the Glenda Early Recovery and Reconstruction Plan.
    Early on Tuesday evening, Salceda declared Albay to be in a state of calamity, with Typhoon Glenda affecting at least 26% of the province's population.

                Due to the geographical location of the Philippines, they are considered as one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries. Located along the boundary of the major tectonic plate and the center of the typhoon belt explains why it is a disaster-prone country, so that is also why every year,  an average of 20 typhoons are visiting the Philippines including typhoon Glenda last 2014.
